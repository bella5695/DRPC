											<h3>These are the recent changes that I've made to the website for usability, presentation, engagement, and design of the website.</h3>

                                        <p> The menu has changed to have different buttons. When you click on the menu, it shows which page you are on. The home page is a logo of the DRPC when you click on the logo, it directs you to the home page on the menu. This is to seperate the different pages, and highlight the page that you are on. It also is to make the home page simple and direct the user to the homepage when you click on the logo. There is a sub menu for certain parts of the menu with a drop-down menu style. These are to access the pages within the main category of type of pages.</p>
                                          <h3> Home Page</h3>
